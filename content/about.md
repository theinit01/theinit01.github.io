# About Me

Hey there! 👋 I’m **Tushar Singh**, a DevOps Engineer and tech tinkerer who loves designing **scalable, secure, and efficient systems**.  
By day, I work on production-grade infrastructure, building automated, reliable pipelines and clusters. By night, I experiment in my **homelab**, pushing the boundaries of what self-hosted technology can do.

## Who Am I?

I thrive at the intersection of **engineering, automation, and experimentation**. From **air-gapped Kubernetes clusters** and **distributed data pipelines** at work to bare-metal setups in my homelab, I enjoy designing systems that are both **robust** and **fun to operate**.  
Problem-solving, learning by doing, and sharing knowledge are at the heart of everything I do.

## What I Do

- **DevOps & Infrastructure** — Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Argo CD, and CI/CD pipelines for scalable, secure production environments.  
- **Data Systems** — Orchestrating workflows with Hadoop, Spark, and Airflow to power analytics and AI workloads.  
- **Homelab Projects** — Running everything **bare metal**, including but not limited too:  
  - **ARR Stack Media** for self-hosted entertainment :) 
  - **Frigate NVR** for smart home surveillance  
  - **n8n** for automating workflows  
  - **WireGuard** for secure networking  
- **Automation & Problem Solving** — Building pipelines, monitoring systems, and infrastructure that “just work” while minimizing manual intervention.  

## What Excites Me?

- Automating repetitive tasks and building **self-healing systems**.  
- Exploring the power of **bare-metal homelabs** to test real-world scenarios.  
- Learning and sharing new tools, technologies, and techniques with the community.  
- Merging **creativity with engineering**, whether through infrastructure or side projects.

## Beyond Work

When I’m not managing clusters or writing YAML (endless YAML 😅), you’ll find me in my homelab experimenting with things.  
I love building things that **teach me something new** and inspire others to tinker too.
